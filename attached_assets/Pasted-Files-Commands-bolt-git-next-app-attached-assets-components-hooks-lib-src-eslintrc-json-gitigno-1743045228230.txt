Code Changes Toast Export and Node Version

fix terminal error
AS

Assistant16 minutes ago

I see there are two main errors in the terminal:

    The toast import error from '/hooks/use-toast'
    TypeError: Promise.withResolvers is not a function

Let's fix the toast import issue first by correcting the exports in use-toast.ts:
hooks/use-toast.ts

For the Promise.withResolvers error, we need to upgrade Node.js to a version that supports this feature. Let's add a .nvmrc file:
.nvmrc

Now let's install the specified Node.js version:
nvm install 20.11.1 && nvm use 20.11.1 && npm install

I'll help fix the terminal errors. There are two main issues:

    The toast import error
    The Promise.withResolvers error in pdf-parser.ts

Let's fix them:

First, let's correct the toast import by updating create/page.tsx:
app/create/page.tsx

Now, let's modify the pdf-parser.ts to handle Promise resolution without using withResolvers:
components/file-upload/pdf-parser.ts

Let's also fix the upload-button.tsx to properly handle the toast:
components/file-upload/upload-button.tsx

I see two main issues causing the errors:

    PDF worker initialization is missing
    File parsing error handling needs improvement

Let's fix them:

    First, let's properly initialize the PDF.js worker:

components/file-upload/pdf-parser.ts

    Now let's update the upload button to better handle errors:

components/file-upload/upload-button.tsx

I notice there's a toast-related error in your Next.js application. The issue is that the toast utility is not properly exported from the hooks directory. Let's fix both the toast hook and its usage:

    First, let's fix the toast hook:

hooks/use-toast.ts

    Now let's fix the create page:

app/create/page.tsx

    For the TipTap SSR warning, we need to modify the editor configuration:

components/resume-editor/editor.tsx

I'll help fix the toast-related errors. The issue is with the toast implementation and imports. Let's fix the related files:
components/ui/use-toast.tsx
hooks/use-toast.ts
components/ui/toaster.tsx

This should resolve the toast-related errors you're seeing. The changes:

    Created proper implementation of useToast
    Fixed circular dependencies
    Updated component implementations to match the shadcn/ui toast system

Try refreshing your app now - the toast functionality should work correctly.

I'll help fix the resume upload error. Looking at the code and error logs, there are a few issues we need to address in the file upload handling. Let's fix the components:
components/file-upload/pdf-parser.ts
components/file-upload/upload-button.tsx
Dependencies
langchain

These changes:

    Add proper error handling in the PDF parser
    Add loading state to the upload button
    Validate file type before processing
    Add better error messages and user feedback
    Install required langchain package for PDF parsing

Try uploading a resume now - you should see proper loading states and error messages if something goes wrong.

I'll help fix the errors. Looking at the logs, there are two main issues:

    Toast component import/export issues
    PDFLoader import error from langchain

Let's fix these one by one:

    First, let's fix the toast-related issues:

components/ui/use-toast.tsx
hooks/use-toast.ts

    Now let's fix the PDFLoader issue by updating to the correct import path:

components/file-upload/pdf-parser.ts

Let's also make sure we have the correct package installed:
Dependencies
@langchain/community

These changes should resolve the errors you're seeing. The key changes are:

    Fixed the toast implementation and exports
    Updated the PDFLoader import to use the web version instead of the fs version
    Added proper error handling in the PDF parser
    Installed the required langchain community package

Try uploading a file now - it should work properly. Let me know if you see any other errors.
